[E.R.19-20.] They were also defendants in a civil suit filed by the City of Los Angeles. Both the civil and criminal matters stemmed from allegations that Fleishman-Hillard had submitted inflated bills in connection with its contract with the City of Los Angeles' Department of Water and Power. [E.R. 20-22.] Fleishman-Hillard is a wholly  <span class="co_starPage"><input alt="metadata" class="co_starPageMetadataItem" type="hidden" value='{ "pageset": "Sce1bca417e6411ddb6a3a099756c05b7", "pageNumber": "3" }'/>*3</span> owned subsidiary of defendant Omnicom Group. [E.R. 19.]</div></div><div class="co_paragraph"><div class="co_paragraphText">At the outset, Fleishman-Hillard directed plaintiff to hire his own attorneys to represent him in connection with all matters arising from the criminal probes and the civil litigation, It specifically recommended the law firm Gibson, Dunn &amp; Crutcher, and made an unqualified promise to plaintiff that it would pay all the firm's bills. [E.R. 20.] In reliance on that promise, plaintiff hired Gibson, Dunn &amp; Crutcher. [E.R. 21.]</div></div><div class="co_paragraph"><div class="co_paragraphText">When Fleishman-Hillard made that promise to plaintiff, however, it was concerned about its own possible indictment, and to forestall that event it was actively attempting to meet the terms of the January 30, 2003 Justice Department mandate entitled <em>Principles of Federal Prosecution of Business Organizations,</em> the so-called “Thompson Memo.” [E.R. 20.] This was a set of prosecutorial guidelines which were then binding on all United States Attorneys pursuant to the §163 of the U.S. Department of Justice Criminal Resource Manual. Those guidelines included cooperation with the government, waiver of the attorney client privilege, and whether the corporate employer was paying attorneys fees for the target employees. Fleishman-Hillard did not disclose that to plaintiff, however, nor did it disclose that if he was indicted then it would cease paying his attorneys fees. [E.R. 20, 25.] A copy of the Thompson Memo is attached for the  <span class="co_starPage"><input alt="metadata" class="co_starPageMetadataItem" type="hidden" value='{ "pageset": "Sce1bca417e6411ddb6a3a099756c05b7", "pageNumber": "4" }'/>*4</span> convenience of the court.</div></div><div class="co_paragraph"><div class="co_paragraphText">In June, 2005, plaintiff was indicted by a federal grand jury for actions undertaken in the service of, and on behalf of, Fleishman-Hillard. [E.R. 22.] In an effort to comply with the Thompson Memo, Fleishman-Hillard stopped paying plaintiffs attorneys fees almost immediately upon his indictment.<sup id="co_tablefootnote_1"><a class="co_footnoteReference" href="#co_tablefootnoteblock_1">1</a></sup> By then, he had been fired and was impecunious. Because Gibson, Dunn had represented him throughout his ordeal, however, and was thus intimately familiar with all of the complexities of the matter, and in view of the fact that he was now facing a federal prosecution, plaintiff effectively had no choice but to continue with Gibson, Dunn's representation. [E.R. 22.] He was unable to pay them, however, and he was ultimately convicted of conspiracy and wire fraud, a conviction which is currently on appeal in this court.

Omnicom's Bylaws Covered Plaintiff; The Complaint Properly Alleged Breach of Written Contract<input id="co_docMarker_7" type="hidden"/></div><div class="co_paragraph"><div class="co_paragraphText">Plaintiff alleged that he was covered by the indemnification provision found at Article IX of Omnicom's corporate by-laws. Omnicom, the corporate parent of defendant Fleishman-Hillard, asked plaintiff to continue to serve the corporation, and as an inducement to do so, it awarded him stock options for Omnicom Group stock. [E.R. 26.] Thus, by the plain wording of the by-laws, plaintiff was in that class of individuals who were entitled to protection under Article IX.</div></div><div class="co_paragraph"><div class="co_paragraphText">The court below simply misread the by-laws when it held: “By its plain language, Section 1 of Article IX only applies to officers and directors of  <span class="co_starPage"><input alt="metadata" class="co_starPageMetadataItem" type="hidden" value='{ "pageset": "Sce1bca417e6411ddb6a3a099756c05b7", "pageNumber": "23" }'/>*23</span> Omnicom.” [E.R. 11,12.] In fact, the language is much broader than that, covering <strong><em>“any person”</em></strong> who was <strong><em>either a</em></strong> “director or officer of the Corporation, or served such other corporation ...at the request of the Corporation in <strong><em>any capacity,</em></strong>...” [E.R. 30.] In other words, the broad language was clearly intended to cover all directors and officers of Omnicom, of course, but also <strong><em>“any person</em></strong>” who served “<strong><em>in any capacity</em></strong>” one of Omnicom Group's other corporations at Omnicom's request. Plaintiff alleged just that, i.e. that he served Fleishman-Hillard, an Omnicom Group company, at the request of Omnicom. He was covered by the language of the by-laws.</div></div><div class="co_paragraph"><div class="co_paragraphText">The trial court also ruled, however, that the circumstances of plaintiff's conviction would preclude coverage in any event. The court reasoned that plaintiffs conviction of a crime requiring proof that he “personally possessed the specific intent to defraud” removed him the scope of the by-laws. [E.R. 12.] Plaintiff concedes that his conviction would ordinarily be sufficient to support a finding that he committed acts which would fall within the exception in Article IX, Section 1(a), but not in this case.</div></div><div class="co_paragraph"><div class="co_paragraphText">As the trial court noted, under the terms of the by-laws plaintiffs conviction does not create a presumption that his conduct fell within the scope of the indemnity exception. Nevertheless, and without any analysis, the court not only  <span class="co_starPage"><input alt="metadata" class="co_starPageMetadataItem" type="hidden" value='{ "pageset": "Sce1bca417e6411ddb6a3a099756c05b7", "pageNumber": "24" }'/>*24</span> indulged in a <em>presumption</em> that plaintiff believed his conduct to be unlawful, but it went on to so find as a matter of law. That was error.</div></div><div class="co_paragraph"><div class="co_paragraphText">Section 1(b) of the by-laws makes sense only if Omnicom intended persons who would otherwise be entitled to indemnity, but for a criminal conviction, to be able to re-litigate in a civil proceeding some elements of their criminal convictions. Furthermore, it also only makes sense if read such that the company has the burden to prove that plaintiff did, in fact, act “with deliberate dishonesty” or “were committed in bad faith.” That did not happen here. Rather, the court simply paid lip service to the “does not create a presumption” language, and then completely disregarded it.</div></div><div class="co_paragraph"><div class="co_paragraphText">Plaintiff is in the class of persons entitled to indemnity under the Omnicom by-laws, and he should be given the opportunity to litigate his claim. If Omnicom wishes to argue that his conviction deprives him of any right to indemnity, then it should have the burden of proving that an exception applies, and plaintiffs conviction, though probative, is nothing more than one piece of evidence which it can introduce.</div></div></div><div class="co_contentBlock co_briefItState co_remarksBlock"><div class="co_headtext co_hAlign2"><div class="co_smallCaps"><div class="co_hAlign2">VI.</div></div></div><div class="co_headtext co_hAlign2"><strong>Conclusion</strong></div><div class="co_paragraph"><div class="co_paragraphText">The issue on this appeal is simply whether plaintiff has adequately pleaded the  <span class="co_starPage"><input alt="metadata" class="co_starPageMetadataItem" type="hidden" value='{ "pageset": "Sce1bca417e6411ddb6a3a099756c05b7", "pageNumber": "25" }'/>*25</span> requisite elements of the enumerated causes of action such that, assuming the truth of the allegations, he has stated claims upon which relief may be granted.
