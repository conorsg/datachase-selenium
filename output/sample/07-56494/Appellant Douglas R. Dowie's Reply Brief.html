L.

Unlike <em>Stein,</em> however, in this case the employer's actions not only violated plaintiffs Constitutional guarantees, but they also were in derogation of California's fundamental public policy as embodied in Labor Code §2802.</div></div><div class="co_paragraph"><div class="co_paragraphText">Plaintiff submits that allowing a Sixth Amendment violation to serve as the basis to deprive plaintiff of his statutory right to indemnity would offend public policy. Furthermore, even if the exception within §2802 were deemed to apply, the <em>Stein</em> decision suggests that an independent right to indemnity, founded on the Sixth Amendment violation, would require enforcement of plaintiff's implied indemnity rights as pleaded in his Second Cause of Action.</div></div></div><div class="co_contentBlock co_briefItState co_remarksBlock"><div class="co_headtext co_hAlign1">A. <em>The Indictment Triggered The Cutoff Of Plaintiffs Fees</em></div><div class="co_paragraph"><div class="co_paragraphText">Plaintiffs Complaint alleged that the decision to stop paying Mr. Dowie's criminal defense fees upon his indictment was motivated by concern over the Thompson Memo, bringing this case squarely within the holding of <em>Stein.</em> [E.R. 23.] Implicitly acknowledging that fact, defendants argue that their fees decision was not motivated by the Thompson Memo, but attribute it to pique over plaintiffs supposed “threat” to expose embarrassing information, and suggest that his wrongful termination case also played a part. They also argue that plaintiffs conviction precludes indemnity in any event. They are wrong on both counts.</div></div><div class="co_paragraph"><div class="co_paragraphText">First, of course, defendants' reasons for cutting off plaintiff's advancement of fees is a fact question which cannot be resolved on a Rule 12(b)(6) motion. Defendants nonetheless ask the court to take judicial notice of comments made by the District Court in its order denying Mr. Dowie's post-trial motion to dismiss the indictment in his criminal case. [Appellees' Brief (“AB” 45-47.] There, the court opined that the decision to cut off defense fees was not the result of the Thompson Memo, but rather was in response to plaintiffs, or his counsel's, threats “to embarrass the company if he did not receive a substantial severance ...”<sup id="co_tablefootnote_1"><a class="co_footnoteReference" href="#co_tablefootnoteblock_1">1</a></sup> [A.B. 23.] That order does not help defendants here.</div></div><div class="co_paragraph"><div class="co_paragraphText">How Mr. Dowie and his civil attorney conducted themselves in the civil litigation was not at issue in the criminal case. The order is opaque as to the basis for its conclusion, and there is nothing in the record in this matter which would permit resolution of the question by this court at the pleading stage in this matter. Suffice it to say that the court's conclusion was as unfortunate as it was wrong.</div></div><div class="co_paragraph"><div class="co_paragraphText">More importantly, however, the District Court's order attached to defendants' brief itself demonstrates that it was plaintiffs indictment which triggered the cutoff of attorneys fees, not anything he did in the civil litigation.<input id="co_docMarker_1" type="hidden"/></div></div><div class="co_paragraph"><div class="co_paragraphText">The order correctly states that “Between the initiation of the investigation and the June 2005 return of the indictment naming Dowie as a defendant, F-H advanced funds to pay for Defendant Dowie's representation by the law firm of Gibson, Dunn &amp; Crutcher.” [AB 45-46.] Plaintiffs employment, however, was terminated on January 5, 2005 [SER 20], and according to the District Court, it was “at that time” that Mr. Dowie's attorney threatened to expose embarrassing information. [AB 46.] Nonetheless, defendant continued to advance Mr. Dowie's fees. Then, in March, 2005, Mr. Dowie filed his wrongful termination suit against Fleishman-Hillard. [AB 46.] Still, defendant continued to advance fees. It was only upon Mr. Dowie's indictment in June, 2005, some five months after his termination and the supposed extortion, and some three months after filing his wrongful termination lawsuit, that defendant stopped advancing fees. [AB 45-46.]</div></div><div class="co_paragraph"><div class="co_paragraphText">Defendants, in short, cannot escape <em>Stein</em> by suggesting that plaintiffs indictment was not the trigger for its decision to stop advancing fees. On the contrary, the evidence strongly suggests otherwise, namely that it was the “menace inherent in the Thompson Memorandum” that motivated the decision.</div></div><div class="co_paragraph"><div class="co_paragraphText"><em>Stein</em> held that an employee's Sixth Amendment rights are violated by an employer which cuts off attorneys fees because of the Thompson Memo. Therefore, <em>a fortiori,</em> the employee would otherwise have had a right to those fees. While it is true, as the government argued in <em>Stein,</em> that an employer might refuse fees for some other, legitimate, reason, if it does so <em>because</em> of the Thompson Memo, then it is a Sixth Amendment violation. Surely, the appropriate remedy cannot be limited to dismissing the indictment if, as in this case, the victim is also left destitute as a consequence of that same violation. That would be half a remedy (albeit an important half!) which fails to address fully the harm caused by the violation. If the cessation of fees advancement was a Sixth Amendment violation, then the remedy must include, at the very least, restitution of those fees.</div></div><div class="co_paragraph"><div class="co_paragraphText">Defendants are mistaken when they say at page 21 of their brief that “Mr. Dowie appears to believe that he is entitled to indemnity ... if he can show that his trial defense was not as good as it could have been if his attorneys had been getting paid by FH.” In fact, plaintiff contends no such thing. Instead, plaintiffs position is that he need not make such a showing. <em>Stein</em> rejected that requirement as both futile and beside the point, a point on which the Second Circuit affirmed:</div><div class="co_paragraph"><div class="co_paragraphText">“He [District Judge Kaplan] further determined that defendants need not show how their defense was impaired: the government's interference with their Sixth Amendment ‘right to be represented as they choose,’ ‘like a deprivation of the right to counsel of their choice, is complete irrespective of the quality of the representation they receive.’ <em>Id.</em> at 369.” <em>U.S. v. Stein,</em> [2<sup>nd</sup> Cir. at 22.]</div></div></div><div class="co_paragraph"><div class="co_paragraphText">While the inquiry may be relevant in plaintiffs appeal of his conviction, his right to be indemnified for the fees he incurred defending the criminal case does not depend on the quality of his representation, nor should it depend on the outcome.</div></div><div class="co_paragraph"><div class="co_paragraphText">Defendant will undoubtedly argue that it bears no liability for doing the government's explicit or implicit bidding as set forth in the Thompson Memo. It is wrong, however, because just as <em>Stein</em> refused to allow the government to escape the consequences of KPMG's actions on its behalf, nor can we allow the employer to escape the consequences of its own actions on the government's behalf, especially when those actions consist of a repudiation of its indemnity obligations resulting in a Sixth Amendment constitutional violation.<input id="co_docMarker_2" type="hidden"/></div></div><div class="co_paragraph"><div class="co_paragraphText">The Second Circuit discussed the intertwined roles of government and employer by virtue of the Thompson Memo:</div><div class="co_paragraph"><div class="co_paragraphText">“State action is established here as a matter of law because the government forced KPMG to adopt its constricted Fees Policy. The Thompson Memorandum itself-which prosecutors stated would be considered in deciding whether to indict KPMG-emphasizes that cooperation will be assessed in part based upon whether, in advancing counsel fees, ‘the corporation appears to be protecting its culpable employees and agents.’ Since defense counsel's objective in a criminal investigation will virtually always be to protect the client, KPMG's risk was that fees for defense counsel would be advanced to someone the government considered culpable. So the only safe course was to allow the government to become (in effect) paymaster.” <em>[Stein</em> at 41.]</div></div></div><div class="co_paragraph"><div class="co_paragraphText">So too in this case. The Thompson Memo caused defendant to follow the safe, if dishonorable, path of abandoning a loyal employee who was facing criminal prosecution for actions undertaken in its service and for its benefit. As a consequence, plaintiff incurred a mountain of debt to his criminal defense counsel, and he is entitled to be indemnified for that debt.</div></div></div><div class="co_contentBlock co_briefItState co_remarksBlock"><div class="co_headtext co_hAlign1">B. <em>The Labor Code §2802 Claim</em></div><div class="co_paragraph"><div class="co_paragraphText">Defendants' brief seems to suggest that Labor Code §2802 should have two different standards, depending on whether it is being applied to a civil action or a criminal action.

It is a distinction without a difference.</div></div><div class="co_paragraph"><div class="co_paragraphText">First, nothing in the statute precludes its application to criminal matters. On the contrary, and as discussed in plaintiffs opening brief, the clear inference from the statutory wording is that it was intended to apply to criminal cases. [AOB 13-17.]</div></div><div class="co_paragraph"><div class="co_paragraphText">Second, defendants' argument at page 16 of their brief that “under Mr. Dowie's view the express exclusion of Labor Code section 2802 would be effectively eliminated” is wrong. Plaintiff does not argue for ignoring the “express exclusion of Labor Code section 2802,” just that it not be expanded by judicial fiat. The “express exclusion” makes clear that employees like plaintiff Dowie enjoy a right to statutory indemnity even in cases in which they committed unlawful acts “in obedience to the directions of the employer, <em>unless</em> the employee, at the time of obeying the directions, believed them to be unlawful.” The mere fact of a subsequent conviction does not establish that condition.</div></div><div class="co_paragraph"><div class="co_paragraphText">A criminal defendant like Mr. Dowie should not be forced to testify in his criminal case solely to establish his subjective belief that his actions were not unlawful. In short, he should not have to make a Fifth Amendment decision based on how it might or might not affect a collateral Labor Code §2802 claim. <input id="co_docMarker_3" type="hidden"/>Also, for example, a polygraph examination which might or might not be admissible in a criminal case would have considerably more relevance and materiality in a case like this where the very essence of the §2802 claim is plaintiff's subjective state of mind.<sup id="co_tablefootnote_2"><a class="co_footnoteReference" href="#co_tablefootnoteblock_2">2</a></sup> The point is simply that, for purposes of §2802, a conviction should not have more read into it than is necessarily there.</div></div><div class="co_paragraph"><div class="co_paragraphText">Finally, defendants argue that there is no right to a defense under the statute, but merely indemnity. That is true, but somewhat beside the point. The issue is not when payment is made, but the certainty that payment will be made. If an employee's criminal defense counsel and the employer both know that indemnity will be required in the end, so long as “course and scope” are established, then the protections of the statute will have been served and plaintiff will be able to defend the criminal case accordingly. This is an important goal, and all the more so where an individual's liberty is at stake.</div></div><div class="co_paragraph"><div class="co_paragraphText">In sum, plaintiff was deprived of his indemnity rights because the government and his employer acted in concert to violate the Sixth Amendment of the Constitution, the California Labor Code, and California's fundamental public policy. Regardless of the outcome of the criminal appeal, plaintiff should be indemnified by defendant Fleishman-Hillard for the attorneys fees and costs incurred defending his actions on its behalf.</div></div></div><div class="co_contentBlock co_briefItState co_remarksBlock"><div class="co_headtext co_hAlign2"><span class="co_smallCaps">II.</span></div><div class="co_headtext co_hAlign2"><em>Any Fair Reading Of The Bylaws Requires Indemnification</em></div><div class="co_paragraph"><div class="co_paragraphText">The Omnicom bylaws, by their express terms, do not require the beneficiary of their indemnity rights to be an officer or director. If they did, the opening sentence of Article IX, Section 1(a) would read, “The Corporation shall indemnify any Officer or Director of the Corporation...” Or, if they wanted to restrict it to employees of Omnicom only, it might read, “The Corporation shall indemnify any employee of the Corporation...” They did not write it that way, however, choosing instead to afford indemnity to “any person” who, among other things, provided service to an Omnicom company at the request of Omnicom. Given that Mr. Dowie was provided with Omnicom stock as an “incentive” and “inducement to continue as an employee” of its wholly owned subsidiary [SER 79], he is in that class of persons who qualifies for indemnity under the bylaws.</div></div><div class="co_paragraph"><div class="co_paragraphText">Defendant argues again that plaintiffs conviction takes him out of the indemnity protection, and that “the District Court's ruling addressed and disposed of [plaintiffs] argument.” [AB 37.] Indeed, the District Court addressed and disposed of plaintiffs entire case, which is why we are here.
